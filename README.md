# car_price_predictor
Car Price Prediction Project

Objective: Develope a machine learning model to predict car prices based on user input data.


Data Preprocessing:

    ---Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.
    
    ---Applied data visualization techniques (e.g., scatter plots,pie plot,line plots, histograms) to analyze relationships between features and car prices.
    
    ---Utilized Label Encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical form.


Modeling:

    ---Implemented a Linear Regression model for car price prediction.
    
    ---Trained and evaluated the model on the cleaned dataset.
    
    ---Integrated user input functionality for real-time price prediction based on key features (e.g., make, model, year, etc.).

Tools/Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib,Seaborn,Label Encoder,Linear Regression,Metrics,Scikit-learn.
